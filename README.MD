# Covid Risk Predictor

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the risk level of a Covid-19 patient based on their current symptoms, status, and medical history. This model will be trained on a dataset of Covid-19 patient records and will be able to classify patients as either low risk or high risk.
